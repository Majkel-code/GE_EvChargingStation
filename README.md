## 🚀 **Overview**  
GE_EvChargingStation is a lightweight charger and vehicle simulator designed to help users simulate charging flows, explore connectivity types, and understand the fundamentals of electric vehicle charging.  

> 🌍 _"Electric vehicles are the future of sustainable transportation."_  

---

## ✨ **Features**  

- ⚡ **Run Server**: Start charger and vehicle servers to simulate charging sessions.  
- 🛠️ **Edit Settings**: Customize charger and vehicle configurations.  
- 🔌 **Simulate Charging**: Run charge sessions for one or two outlets simultaneously.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: View logs or use a dedicated display (Electron app supported).

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  

| **Technology** | **Description** |  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
| [FastAPI]       | High-performance web framework. |  
| [Python]        | Version 3.11 or higher. |  
| [JavaScript]    | For front-end and Electron integration. |  
| [Electron]      | Desktop app for real-time monitoring. |

## 📦 **Installation**  

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.11+ is installed.  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GE_EvChargingStation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ **RUN**  

### 1️⃣ **Running the Server (from Code)**  

Open two terminal tabs and execute the following commands:  

**First Tab**:  
```sh
cd GE_EvChargingStation
python3 CHARGER/charger_server.py
```  

**Second Tab**:  
```sh
cd GE_EvChargingStation
python3 VEHICLE/vehicle_server.py
```  
It should create also directories where you will find log files

![img](./.assets/console_tree.png "console tree log")

📝 NOTE - *_history.json files will create when first connection CHARGER ↔ VEHICLE will up

### 2️⃣ **Running the server (Standalone App)**
```sh
cd GE_EvChargingStation/BUILDER
```
Here you should see structure as below.

![img](./.assets/standalone_app.png "console tree app")
- Structure begins of component - then out_(date of build)
- ⚠️ If you want to make another build just perform
  ```sh 
  .venv/bin/pyinstaller BUILDER/[component].spec
  ```
  after some time it should create directory with actual date of build and application inside
   - ⚠️ Old build will not be deleted automatically!

From here just run these apps
- Logs and Authorization directory will create in your current directory

### 3️⃣ **Use the Server (Without Display)**  

In a third terminal tab, send a `curl` request or use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/):  
```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/is_alive
```  
⚠️ Some of the endpoints needs AUTHORIZATION_KEY (host_key.txt) Charger will create it in first run
- You can paste 📋 it to ${GLOBAL_AUTH_KEY} in [./tests/ROBOT_TESTS/testdata/variables/globals.resource](./tests/ROBOT_TESTS/testdata/variables/globals.resource) to perform automation tests
- Use it as authorization header via Postman
- Send curls via terminal
### 4️⃣ **Optional: Running the Display**  

- To open setup for display please follow this link -> [CLICK HERE](./DISPLAY/README.md) 

---

## 🌐 **API Endpoints**  

### **Server**  
- **Check server status**:  
  ```sh
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/is_alive
  ```  

### **Charger**  
- **Retrieve all charger settings**:  
  ```sh
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/charger/all
  ```  
- **Start charging using CHAdeMO protocol**:  
  ```sh
  curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/charger/start_chademo'
  ```  

### **Vehicle**  
- **Connect a vehicle using AC outlet**:  
  ```sh
  curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle_ac/connect'
  ```  
- **Retrieve all vehicle settings (AC outlet)**:  
  ```sh
  curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle_ac/all'
  ```

## 📝 **TODO**  

- [ ] Add support for running the software on external machines (Linux) with a dedicated display.  
- [ ] Improve API documentation with examples.  
- [ ] Add more charging protocols.
